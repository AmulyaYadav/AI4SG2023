								<h2>Scope and Topics</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
							The field of Artificial Intelligence stands at an inflection point, and there could be many different directions in which the future of AI research could unfold. Accordingly, there is a growing interest to ensure that current and future AI research is used in a responsible manner for the benefit of humanity (i.e., for social good). To achieve this goal, a wide range of perspectives and contributions are needed, spanning the full spectrum from fundamental research to sustained deployments in the real-world.
							</p>
							This workshop will explore how AI research can contribute to solving challenging problems faced by current-day societies. For example, what role can AI research play in promoting health, sustainable development and infrastructure security? How can AI initiatives be used to achieve consensus among a set of negotiating self-interested entities (e.g., finding resolutions to trade talks between countries)? To address such questions, this workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners across different strands of AI research and a wide range of important real-world application domains. The objective is to share the current state of research and practice, explore directions for future work, and create opportunities for collaboration. In addition, the workshop will place a special emphasis on highlighting AI approaches for tackling the COVID-19 pandemic. The organizers believe that AI research has an important role to play in providing unique insights about the pandemic and developing targeted responses; we encourage submissions from both AI researchers as well as epidemiologists, health policy researchers, and other domain experts who are interested in engaging with the IJCAI community.

							<h3>Topics</h3>
							The workshop organizers invite paper submissions on the following (and related) topics:
							<ul>
							<li>Applications of Learning and Optimization in Societally Beneficial Domains</li>
							<li>AI Approaches for COVID-19</li>
							<li>Real-world applications of game theory for security</li>
							<li>Cybersecurity</li>
							<li>Security applications of machine learning</li>
							<li>Foundations of game theory for security</li>
							<li>Adversarial/robust learning</li>
							<li>Fake news control</li>
							<li>Privacy protection</li>
							<li>Agent/human interaction for preference elicitation and optimization</li>
							<li>Protection against environmental crime</li>
							<li>Explainable Artificial Intelligence</li>
							<li>AI Environmental Sustainability</li>
							<li>AI for Democracy in the Developing World</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								Finally, the workshop will welcome papers that describe the release of benchmarks and data sets 
								that can be used by the community to solve fundamental problems of interest, including in 
								machine learning and optimization for health systems and urban networks, to mention but a few examples. 
							</p>

							<h3>Format</h3> 
							<p> The workshop will be a one-day 
							meeting.  It will include a number of (possibly parallel) technical  
							sessions, a virtual poster session where presenters can discuss their work, with
							the aim of  further fostering collaborations, multiple invited
							speakers covering crucial challenges for the field of
							AI for Social Good and learning and will
							conclude with a panel discussion.</p>

							<h3>Attendance</h3>
							Attendance is open to all. At least one author of each accepted submission must be present at the workshop.

							<!--<h4>Fast Track (Rejected AAMAS or IJCAI papers)</h4>
							<p>
							Rejected AAMAS or IJCAI papers may be submitted to AI4SG along with previous reviews and scores and an optional letter indicating how the 
							authors have addressed the reviewers comments.
							<br>
							Please use the submission link above and indicate that the submission is a resubmission from 
							of an AAMAS/IJCAI rejected paper. Also OptLearnMAS submission, reviews and optimal letter 
							need to be compiled into a single pdf file.
							<br>
							These submissions will not undergo the regular review process, but a light one, performed by the 
							chairs, and will be accepted if the previous reviews are 
							judged to meet the workshop standard. 
							</p>-->

							<p>	
							All papers must be submitted in PDF format, using the <a href="https://www.ijcai.org/authors_kit">IJCAI-21 author kit</a>. 
							Submissions should include the name(s), affiliations, and email addresses of all authors. 
							<br>
							Submissions will be refereed on the basis of technical quality, novelty, significance, and 
							clarity. Each submission will be thoroughly reviewed by at least two program committee members.
							<br>
							Submissions of papers rejected from the AAMAS 2021 and IJCAI 2021 technical program are welcomed. 
							<!-- Papers will be selected for oral and/or poster presentation at the workshop.  -->
