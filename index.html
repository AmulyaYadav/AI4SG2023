								<h2>Scope and Topics</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
							The field of Artificial Intelligence stands at an inflection point, and there could be many
different directions in which the future of AI research could unfold. Accordingly, there is a
growing interest to ensure that current and future AI research is used in a responsible manner
for the benefit of humanity (i.e., for social good). To achieve this goal, a wide range of
perspectives and contributions are needed, spanning the full spectrum from fundamental
research to sustained deployments in the real-world.
							</p>
							<p>This workshop will explore how AI research can contribute to solving challenging problems
faced by current-day societies. For example, what role can AI research play in promoting health,
sustainable development and infrastructure security? How can AI initiatives be used to achieve
consensus among a set of negotiating self-interested entities (e.g., finding resolutions to trade
talks between countries)? To address such questions, this workshop will bring together
researchers and practitioners across different strands of AI research and a wide range of
important real-world application domains. The objective is to share the current state of research
and practice, explore directions for future work, and create opportunities for collaboration. The
workshop will be a very nice complement to the AAAI Special Track on AI for Social Impact as it
will provide a forum where researchers interested in this area can connect in a more direct way.</p>
							
							<p>This workshop complements the objectives of the main conference by providing a
forum for AI algorithm designers, such as those working in the areas of agent-based modelling,
machine learning, spatio-temporal models, deep learning, explainable AI, fairness, social choice,
non-cooperative and cooperative game theory, convex optimization, and planning under
uncertainty on innovative and impactful real-world applications. Specifically, this
workshop serves two purposes. First, the workshop will provide an opportunity to showcase
real-world deployments of AI research. More often than not, unexpected practical challenges
emerge when solutions developed in the lab are deployed in the real world, which makes it
challenging to utilize complex and well thought out computational/modeling advances.
Learning about the challenges faced in these deployments during the workshop will help us
understand lessons of moving from the lab to the real world. Second, the workshop will provide
opportunities to showcase AI systems which dynamically adapt to changing environments, are
robust to errors in execution and planning, and handle uncertainties of different kinds that are
common in the real world. Addressing these challenges requires collaboration from different
communities including machine learning, game theory, operations research, social science, and
psychology. This workshop is structured to encourage a lively exchange of ideas between
members from these communities. We encourage submissions to the workshop from: (i)
computer scientists who have used (or are currently using) their AI research to solve important
real-world problems for society’s benefit in a measurable manner; (ii) interdisciplinary
researchers combining AI research with various disciplines (e.g., social science, ecology, climate,
health, psychology and criminology); and (iii) engineers and scientists from organizations who
aim for social good, and look to build real multi-agent systems.</p>

							<h3>Topics</h3>
							Topics of interest include, but
are not limited to the areas identified in the AAAI Special Track on AI for Social Impact:
							<ul>

<li>AISI: Underserved Communities</li>
<li>AISI: Socially Responsible AI: Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency</li>
<li>AISI: Other Social Impact</li>
</ul>
							<p>
								Finally, the workshop will welcome papers that describe the release of benchmarks and data sets 
								that can be used by the community to solve fundamental problems of interest, including in 
								machine learning and optimization for health systems and urban networks, to mention but a few examples. 
							</p>

							<h3>Format</h3> 
							<p> The workshop will be a one-day 
							meeting.  It will include a number of (possibly parallel) technical  
							sessions, a poster session where presenters can discuss their work, with
							the aim of  further fostering collaborations, multiple invited
							speakers covering crucial challenges for the field of
							AI for Social Good and learning and will
							conclude with a panel discussion.</p>

							<h3>Attendance</h3>
							Attendance is open to all. At least one author of each accepted submission must be present at the workshop.
